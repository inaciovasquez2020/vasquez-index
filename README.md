## Overview

The **Vasquez Index** is the public registry layer for the research program of  
**Inacio F. Vasquez**.

This repository does not host theory, code, or experimental material.  
It functions as a **stable, citable interface** that links to:

- canonical scientific operating systems,
- externally auditable infrastructure,
- versioned research artifacts,
- formal verification layers.

Unlike a standard software repository, this index is designed to remain
**structurally stable over decades**, serving as a persistent reference point
for institutions, referees, and archival systems.

## Scientific Infrastructure (URF)

The primary registered system is the **Scientific Infrastructure (URF)**,
which functions as a public operating system for foundational theory.

### Root (Truth Layer)

https://github.com/inaciovasquez2020/scientific-infrastructure

### Website (Human Interface)

https://inaciovasquez2020.github.io/scientific-infrastructure/

### Canonical Release

https://github.com/inaciovasquez2020/scientific-infrastructure/releases/tag/v1.0

This root defines:

- the canonical module set,
- governance rules,
- citation surfaces,
- reproducibility contracts,
- frozen cryptographic snapshots.

All other registered systems must reference this root.

## Tier A Modules (Canonical)

The following modules constitute the **canonical Tier A release**.

Citation should include **both**:
- the root DOI (Scientific Infrastructure), and  
- the specific module identifier.

- **urf-core**

## Core Research Objects

The index tracks the development and verification of the following
structural pillars:

1. **Spectral Gap Rigidity Wall**  
   Resolving the Local → Global correspondence problem.

2. **Unified Rigidity Framework (URF)**  
   Formalizing logic-width dependency and structural invariants.

3. **Chronos / EntropyDepth**  
   Temporal operator bounds and information flow limits.

4. **Radiative Rigidity**  
   Structural constraints on high-flux propagation regimes.

These objects are not narratives; they are **formal systems with executable
artifacts** located in the registered modules.

---

## Purpose & Protocol

The Vasquez Index exists to provide:

- **Registry Stability**  
  Permanent URLs for institutional citation.

- **Structural Traceability**  
  Every listed object resolves to a versioned repository.

- **Auditability**  
  All claims are externally verifiable via public artifacts.

- **No Theory Hosting**  
  This index never duplicates content from canonical modules.

## Registry Rules

This index enforces the following invariants:

1. Only **canonical roots** may be listed.  
2. Each registered system must:
   - have a tagged release,
   - expose a public citation surface,
   - be externally auditable.  
3. Experimental, personal, or business repositories are out of scope.  
4. All entries must link to a frozen infrastructure layer.

Violation of any rule invalidates registry status.

## Citation

This repository itself is a citable registry object.
