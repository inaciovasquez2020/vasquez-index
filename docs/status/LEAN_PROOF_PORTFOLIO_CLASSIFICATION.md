# Lean Proof Portfolio Classification

Date: 2026-04-27

Portfolio class: **INFRASTRUCTURE_DOCUMENTATION**

Role:

Canonical portfolio index and classifier. It records status; it does not independently prove theorem claims.

## Meaning

This file defines how this repository may be described inside the public Lean proof portfolio.

## Allowed description

infrastructure; documentation; verifier support; public index; exposition

## Forbidden description

This repository must not be described as any of the following unless the relevant proof is present in this repository without using `axiom`, `admit`, `sorry`, `: True` theorem stubs, placeholder witnesses, dashboards, ledgers, or external narrative claims:

- theorem-complete Lean proof repository;
- solved Clay problem;
- solved Millennium Prize problem;
- proof of RH;
- proof of P vs NP;
- proof of Yang--Mills mass gap;
- proof of Hodge;
- proof of BSD;
- proof of Navier--Stokes;
- proof of Poincare or smooth Poincare;
- proof of Collatz, Goldbach, twin primes, or ABC;
- externally verified theorem closure.

## Classification rule

- Proof-facing means the repository may be evaluated as a Lean proof artifact, subject to its stated limits.
- Conditional frontier means the repository may present reductions, assumptions, executable checks, or open obstructions, but not theorem closure.
- Infrastructure/documentation means the repository supports, records, renders, or explains work, but is not itself a proof repository.
- Legacy/scaffold means the repository is retained for provenance or development and must not be used as proof evidence.

## Public sentence

`vasquez-index` is infrastructure/documentation, not a theorem-proof repository.
