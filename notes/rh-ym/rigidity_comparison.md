# RH vs Yang–Mills: Rigidity Comparison (Structural)

Goal: compare the “final wall” form:
- RH: Euler–Gram coercivity / defect exclusion
- YM: Jacobi coercivity / OS quantization obstruction

Status: DRAFT (conceptual, non-claiming).

## Relation to URF Synthesis

This comparison is summarized structurally in the URF synthesis paper:
`papers/urf-synthesis/`.

That document provides the global reduction template within which RH and
Yang–Mills occupy parallel but distinct final walls.
